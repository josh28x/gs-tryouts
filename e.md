### Engineer – Associate (Optional Remote)
Preferable Location(s): Sydney, Australia
Work Type: Full Time
The DevOps Team at Enosi is responsible for the development of Enosi’s Powertracer Platform. At Enosi, the developers also own the operational support of the platform.



We have rewritten Powertracer to scale to over a hundred thousand households, businesses and generation sources, trading their energy and delivering traceability of supply to customers. At this scale we will be responsible for delivering the trading and tracing between supply and demand of electrical energy in the gigawatt hours a year range.



We are looking to grow out the DevOps team and if working across a codebase encompassing Go, Ruby, Javascript and Python with Terraform to build infrastructure, and a mixture of containers and serverless applications interest you we would love to talk.



If you are ready to challenge an industry that has long lagged behind the innovation curve, and be part of driving emissions to true zero, we want to hear from you.



Associate Engineer



We are looking for recent university graduates, with a degree in software engineering, electrical engineering, telecommunications engineering or computer science, or if you have undertaken an alternative “learn to code”. You will join us as an Associate Engineer, with six month rotations in the different engineering domains:

Front end engineering

Back end engineering

Infrastructure and observability engineering

At the completion of the three rotations, you will have the opportunity to progress to a software or infrastructure engineer role in an area that interests you (notwithstanding business needs).



Examples of problems you'll be solving



Introducing new React components to Powertracer’s frontend

Owning the introduction of new API features in our microservices

Integrating new API features from microservices through the GraphQL interface for presentation in the front end

Refining the observability capabilities across all services, including the front end

Refactoring Terraform modules used in the deployment of infrastructure an applications



You are great because…



You’ve completed your degree or coursework in software engineering or related field

You’ve shown your interest in your career path through personal projects that go beyond the requirements of your education program

You may have some professional software engineering experience, between one and two years

You understand the importance of maintaining source code, in particular using git repositories (we’re a Github team)

You are aware of the software development life cycle, particularly in a culture of continuous deployment (we love Buildkite)

You understand the importance of clear documentation, and are willing to contribute to it



Bonus points



You’ve had experience working with cloud service providers (we use AWS, but the principles apply across the major providers)

You’ve learnt a little (or a lot) about how Terraform can make life easier

You’ve learnt a little (or a lot) about Go, and how it can be leveraged in serverless and container solutions

You’ve learnt a little (or a lot) about React and GraphQL, especially if you’ve built some projects with it

You’ve spent time working with Atlassian’s Jira and Confluence products

You’re comfortable working remotely, communicating primarily over Slack (chat, voice and video)



You can show us your technical experience



We will want to understand more about your skills, including your engineering track record, experience across the software development lifecycle, agile methods, devops, incorporation of testing. Having some example work that could be reviewed would be appreciated.
