Gridsight is a rapidly growing Grid/CleanTech startup on a mission to accelerate global electrification and decarbonisation. We are building a vertical SaaS platform for electricity utilities, enabling them to modernise grid operations and unlock transformational flexibility capabilities such as dynamic operating envelopes and flexible interconnections. Having recently raised our Series A funding from Airtree Ventures, Energy Transition Ventures and Area VC, we are poised for rapid growth and are seeking talented individuals to join us on our mission.

As a Graduate Data Engineer at Gridsight, you’ll engage your passion for distributed renewables with your experience leading and owning data pipelines to enhance and scale our platform to hundreds of thousands of meters across the globe. In this opportunity to design, develop, and optimise data pipelines and architectures for electricity distribution networks, you’ll play a critical role in redefining and revolutionising the way utilities can enable the decentralisation and decarbonisation of the grid. This is an entry-level position open to 2024/2025 graduates. 

Key Responsibilities

    Create scalable and efficient production-quality ETL pipelines to handle large volumes of data from various sources.
    Integrate and transform a variety of meter and GIS data sources into common Gridsight schemas.
    Manage the end-to-end execution of customer data pipelines and remediate any failures.
    Ensure data accuracy, consistency, and integrity by implementing robust data validation and governance practices; monitor and optimise data pipelines and queries to ensure high performance and low latency.

    Previous experience as a Data Engineering intern, preferably with delivering projects to external stakeholders or clients.
    Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, with a proactive attitude towards identifying and resolving technical challenges.
    Self-starter mentality; you’re able to independently prioritise tasks and manage time effectively with minimal oversight.
    Excellent communication skills and ability to collaborate effectively within a start-up environment.
